      <p>So, getting started, why did I decide to create this homelab, and what does that mean? For anyone who is unfamiliar with what a homelab is, “A homelab is an environment, computers, in this context, equipped for experimentation or research” (<a href="https://noted.lol/homelabs-and-learning/">Click here for more information</a>). For me, the idea of a homelab was intriguing because it offers a way for me to get hands on experience with different types of technologies, and to experiment with them. As an Information Science student at Michigan State University, I am looking to establish my career within the Information Technology industry. It has become my passion, and my homelab fuels my ambition to learn more about modern technologies, cyber security practices, and networking. Aside from learning, my homelab has practical applications that make my life easier. By utilizing things like file share, this allows me to easily access my files without having to use a cloud storage provider like OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon Drive, etc. Cloud storage services like OneDrive give me issues, and for me, setting up my own server and enabling file share has made it easier for me to access files across all my devices, while simultaneously keeping my files safer and viewed only by my eyes.</p>
      <p>Here's a diagram of my current homelab, I'll go more in depth later. This is just a visualization to give you a better understanding of what I've accomplished so far.</p>
